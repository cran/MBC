Description: Calibrate and apply multivariate bias correction algorithms
    for climate model simulations of multiple climate variables. Three methods
    described by Cannon (2016) <doi:10.1175/JCLI-D-15-0679.1> and 
    Cannon (2018) <doi:10.1007/s00382-017-3580-6> are implemented —
    (i) MBC Pearson correlation (MBCp), (ii) MBC rank correlation (MBCr),
    and (iii) MBC N-dimensional PDF transform (MBCn) — as is the Rank
    Resampling for Distributions and Dependences (R2D2) method.
